# Backlog for typopo

* consider refactoring sentence capitalizing as it is causing multiple exclusions
	* consider not correcting capital letters within brackets (in 1.5 range)
* improve identification of double quotes that are next to a punctuation but that are not enclosing the whole sentence.
	* e.g. "Because of this, it’s common to have “namespace pollution”, where completely unrelated code shares global variables."
* refactor identification of multiple dots, together with capital letter.
* consider resolving single-word widows
* add non-breaking space after ordinal numbers

* add support for math equations spacing
* fix numeral format
